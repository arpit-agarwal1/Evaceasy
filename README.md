#Abstract

The application allows a seamless network between an evacuating organisation and an evacuee.

#Functionality

The core functionality of the app lies with the process of networking the evacuating organisation with people in need of emergency support in times of natural disasters.
The basic functions are divided into two distinct versions of the app. One for the evacuator and one for the evacuee.

#Evacuator functions
1. Broadcasts distress signals to evacuees via SMS and push notifications
2. Seamless network with evacuee -> chat support and calling 
3. shelter/evacuation spot to shelter/evacuation spot communications

    Communication between evacuating organisations, ensuring capacity details, resource databases and backup alternatives for excess evacuees.
    
4. GPS tracking of stranded evacuees (applicable even with no network connection as GPS is a satellite based radionavigation system.)
5. Databases of evacuees, safe houses available and refugee camps if needed

#Evacuee functions
1. Family accounts

    One common account for multiple individual accounts with live locations of each individual accessible to the family account members.

    Minors and the elderly added as non-account holders (No GPS tracking)

2. Basic manual - first aid techniques, resource management, etc.
3. Navigation using google maps APIs to nearest shelter/evacuation spot.
4. Contact numbers to evacuators and chat support
5. Push buttons confirming presence at said shelter/evacuation spot

#Benefits
1. Faster evacuations with lower evacuator validation as validation is handled by the app by the following examples

    a. Database of evacuees availaible beforehand to evacuator for total expected evacuations, leads to resource allocation and transport to sufficient extent

    b. Available database allows the evacuator to check evacuees missing or stranded, without headcounts and manual validation.

    c. Evacuators can communicate easier shelter to shelter for vacancies or resources to ensure smooth flow of evacuations

2. Networking of evacuator-evacuee

    a. Faster response to imminent threats

    b. Beforehand locations available to evacuees, ensuring faster evacuee arrivals to said shelter/evac spots.

    c. Faster communication between evacuator and stranded evacuees.

    d. Chat responses with immediate support

3. Family accounts

    a. Communications between separated family members

    b. Accountability of minors and the elderly 

    c. Location pinging to access family member locations during evacuation and emergencies.


#Additional notes

The applications currently available only give basic information for preparedness and processes, while our application networks the people and the organisations, both before and after disaster has struck.
